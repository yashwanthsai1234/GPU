Q1)How many total thread blocks do we use? 
       After computing the below formula to get the grid size 
	dim3 Grid_size((int)(dim-1)/Grid_of_blocks.x+1),(int)(dim-1)/Grid_of_blocks.y+1));
	dim value we have is 1000 and block size is 16
	So dim3 Grid_size((int)(1000-1)/16+1),(int)(1000-1)/16+1);
       On applying dim3 function we get 63x63 thread blocks
Q2)Are all thread blocks full? That is, do all threads in the thread block have data to operate on?
 	No all the thread blocks are not full because
	We have 16x16 block size and 63x63 grid size, so we have 4 blocks in x axis(columns) and 4 blocks in y axis(rows) in total 64x64 blocks out of this 63x63 blocks are filled. The threads in last (remaining) blocks are empty.
Q3)How can this basic Matrix Addition program be improved? (What changes do you think can be made to speed up the code?)	We can optimize the code by reducing the memory transfers between host and device.
	We can also use shared memory to lower the latency.
